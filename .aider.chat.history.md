#### Code the following app

#### "Relax, focus, and have fun! Spin your colorful virtual fidget spinner and watch it glide smoothly. Tap to boost the speed, unlock new designs, and enjoy satisfying animations with every twist. Perfect for quick stress relief or just a playful break - spin, watch, and chill!

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in the following files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create or update the todo file that describes the logo image to generate.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

I need to create a new file for the logo image description.  
Please add the following file to the chat:

```
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
```

Once that file is added, I can provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks to update `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` and create the logo todo.

#### apply changes  

I need the current contents of `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` so I can replace the `title` and `description` values.  
Please add that file to the chat. Once I have it, I’ll also create the `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` file with the logo description.

A vibrant, stylized fidget spinner in motion, with rotating colored segments against a light pastel background. The spinner is centered, its arms are bright primary colors (red, blue, green, yellow) and the center is a dark gray. The background is a soft gradient from light blue to white, giving a calm, playful feel. The image should convey motion and relaxation.
